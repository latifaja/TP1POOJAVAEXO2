French Verb Conjugator for First-Group Verbs
In this exercise, a class Main is instantiated, which contains the main method of the program. This program is designed to read a first-group verb (a regular verb ending in "er") and display its conjugation in the present tense.

Implementation Details
Reading the Verb:

The program starts by creating a Scanner instance to read user input from the console.
After prompting the user to enter a verb, the nextLine() method captures the entered string.
Verb Verification:

The program verifies if the verb ends with "er" using the endsWith() method. This ensures that only a first-group verb is processed.
Verb Conjugation:

If the verb is valid, the verbâ€™s stem is extracted by removing the last two letters ("er") with the substring() method.
The conjugation is then displayed for all persons in the present tense:

je    : je + stem + e
tu    : tu + stem + es
il    : il + stem + e
nous  : nous + stem + ons
vous  : vous + stem + ez
ils   : ils + stem + ent
Error Handling:

If the verb does not end with "er," an error message is displayed, indicating that the input is not a first-group verb.
